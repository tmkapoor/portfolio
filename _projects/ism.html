para-1: "IStyleMYself is a fashion e-commerce app that tries to build in elements of serendipity into shopping. The problem with search is you can't find something you're not looking for. I began by setting 2 research questions; <strong>do users understand what the app does?</strong> and <strong>do users want serendipity in their shopping experience?</strong></br>I began with a simple user test of the app, which revealed the first problem: <strong>users did not understand how the app was suggesting, the selection seemed random</strong>. The second thing I did was to conduct surveys and interviews to understand how women (16-24 year old) go about finding items to buy. Which validated the base assumption, that people do want a certain element of serendipity in their shopping experience."

para-2: "Once I knew that our base assumption for the app was valid, I began a second set of user tests, conducting thinkaloud user tests, to identify usability issues in the app and why users aren't understand thing the concept behind the app. To keep things brief the training period for the ML algo to understand the users was not explained. The other big issue with the app was that the ML was so good that it would suggest items the user already owned. To solve the problem we introduced a very simple splash screen to explain what te app is doing and that teh users need to train the app and secondly, we introduced a 'I own this' tag for items so the app would know what items the user already owns, this also helped the ML algo undersand what items the user had \"commited\" to already, thereby showing high intent."
